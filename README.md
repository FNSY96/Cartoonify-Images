# Cartoonify-Images
1st lab in Computer Vision course (CS-4E3) spring semester 2019. This lab is a hands-on **OpenCV** library in python besides it is a direct application and in depth understanding for edge detection and image filters.

## Project Environment
1. Python 3
2. OpenCV2 Library
3. Matplotlib Library
4. Numpy Library

The project is developed in [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb) environment.

## Project Steps
1. Generating a black-and-white sketch
- Noise Reduction Using Median Filter
- Edge Detection Using Laplacian Filter

2. Generating a color painting and a cartoon
- Applying bilateral filter for image smoothing
- ANDing output from step 1 and output from step 2
